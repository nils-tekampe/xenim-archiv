# xenim-archiv
This little program checks the JSON API of xenim.de and looks for running streams
For all running episodes, the name of the corresponding Podcast is acquired and the stream is saved to disk.
This program requires the tool streamripper to be available in the path. If you have any questions, please let me know via nils@tekampe.org.
